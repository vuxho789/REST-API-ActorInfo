# REST-API-ActorInfo
- This is a university project implementing a Flask-Restx data service that allows a client to read and store information about actors/actresses, and allows the consumers to access the data through a REST API.

- The project utilises an external API which which provides a detailed list of TV shows and people. The retrieved information is then stored locally in a SQLite database.

## API Endpoints
